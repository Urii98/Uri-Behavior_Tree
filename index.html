									<h2><a href="#">The basics of<br />
									Behavior trees</a></h2>
								</header>
								<header>
									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ai2.png" alt="" /></span>A <b>behavior tree</b> (BT) is a hierarchical structure of tasks and decisions that are used to model the AI(Artificial Intelligence) behavior in a game. Graphically represented as a tree, a way of structuring information hierarchically, that is widely used in Computer Science. Behavior trees are a powerful tool for game developers and other AI practitioners because they provide a <b>flexible</b> and intuitive way to design <u>complex decision-making systems</u> by breaking down the decision-making process into a series of simple, modular <b>components(nodes)</b>. The problem that behavior trees help to solve is the challenge of creating <b>intelligent agents</b> that can make complex decisions in <b>real-time</b>, while also being responsive to player input and able to adapt to changing game conditions.</p>

									<p>Traditional AI techniques, such as rule-based systems and finite-state machines, can quickly become unwieldy and difficult to manage as the complexity of the game increases. Behavior trees provide a more scalable and modular approach to designing AI behaviors. Additionally, behavior trees have the potential for <b>reusability</b> across multiple projects, which can save time and resources for game studios.</p>

									<h2>State of the art</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/halo.jpg" alt="" /></span>The concept of behavior trees was first introduced in a paper by <b>M. J. Mateas and A. Stern</b> in 2004, and has since then evolved into one of the most common approaches for developing game AI. BTs have emerged as a popular tool Sfor modelling artificial intelligence (AI) in games since their use in the <b>Halo 2</b>. BTs are often used to represent the decision making of a <b>non-player character (NPC)</b>. Many game engines, such as <u>Unity</u> and <u>Unreal Engine</u>, provide built-in support for Behavior Trees, making them easy to implement in game development.</p>
									<p>In addition to the built-in behavior tree systems that come with game engines, there are also third-party libraries and tools that offer more advanced features and flexibility. One popular example is <u>BehaviorTree.CPP</u>, an open-source C++ library for creating behavior trees that is used in a wide range of applications, including video games. Another example is the <u>Behavior Tree Editor</u>, a visual tool for creating and editing behavior trees that can be used with various game engines and frameworks. This tool allows developers to design and test complex behavior trees more easily and quickly than writing code manually.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/unreal.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Although there are already libraries or software where Behavior Trees are implemented, the goal of this project was to <b>implement a Behavior Tree from scratch</b> that could be used in the video game projects we develop at the university. To achieve this, I gathered valuable information from sources such as books. Three particularly helpful <b>books</b> were:</p>
									<ol>
										<li style="text-align: left;">Artificial Intelligence for Games by Millington and Funge</li>
										<li style="text-align: left;"><em>Game Coding Complete</em> by McShaffry</li>
										<li style="text-align: left;"><em>C++ Primer</em> by Lippman, Lajoie, and E.Moo</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Additionally, I found the following <b>papers</b> to be particularly informative and straightforward:</p>
									<ul>
										<li style="text-align: left;">Marcotte, R., & Hamilton, H. J. (2017). Behavior trees for modelling artificial intelligence in games: A tutorial. The Computer Games Journal, 6, 171-184</li>
										<li style="text-align: left;">Planning, M. CMSC 425: Lecture 21 Artificial Intelligence for Games: Decision Making</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I also drew inspiration from <b>previous implementations</b> created by others, such as those found on GitHub repositories like <a href="https://github.com/idmillington/aicore"><b>aicore</b></a> and <a href="https://github.com/miccol/Behavior-Tree"><b>miccol</b></a>.</p>
